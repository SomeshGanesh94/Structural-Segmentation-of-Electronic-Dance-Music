# Tempo, beat and downbeat estimation for electronic dance music

This project aims to estimate the tempo (in BPM or beats per minute), the locations of the beats and downbeats of a song in the genre of electronic dance music using some feature extraction and autocorrelation and cross-correlation techniques.

All the files are included in the [MATLAB_files](https://github.com/SomeshGanesh94/Tempo-beat-and-downbeat-estimation-for-electronic-dance-music/tree/master/MATLAB_files) folder. A simple GUI (made in MATLAB) which detects the tempo of an input song and loops over beats (parameter decided by user) can be found in the [MATLAB_GUI_demo](https://github.com/SomeshGanesh94/Tempo-beat-and-downbeat-estimation-for-electronic-dance-music/tree/master/MATLAB_GUI_demo) folder. 

The detailed algorithm, experiments, results and analysis can be found in the [final_report.pdf](https://github.com/SomeshGanesh94/Tempo-beat-and-downbeat-estimation-for-electronic-dance-music/blob/master/final_report.pdf) file.
